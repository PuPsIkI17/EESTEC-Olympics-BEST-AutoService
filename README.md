# ESTEC-BEST-AUTOSERVICE
Project developed at a 12 hours hackaton at UIPath

Description
Nowadays , every car owner deals with the problem of finding a suitable auto service when having problems with his car.
Therefore we decided to create an application that can help car owners. Firstly, we created a database with different auto
services using web scraping that navigates to different web pages and stores information. Secondly , we built a searching 
engine that sorts the entries in the database according to their relevance. It selects the auto services according to your
location , car model and problems. For the moment the user has to manually insert the key words that represent their car's
problems. In the future we will automate this step with the help of an automatic car diagnoser that will send data to our
application.

Applications Used
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and AJAX for designing the input area. The project was developed mostly in UIPath Studio.
